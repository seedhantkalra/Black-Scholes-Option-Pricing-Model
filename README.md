# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

## Overview

This project implements the Black-Scholes model in Python to calculate the theoretical prices of European call and put options. The Black-Scholes model is a fundamental concept in financial mathematics, widely used for option pricing. It takes into account factors such as the current price of the underlying asset, the option's strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate.

## Features

- **European Option Pricing**: Calculates the price of European call and put options.
- **Greeks Calculation**: Computes option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho) to measure sensitivities to various parameters.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can input their own values for the underlying asset price, strike price, volatility, time to expiration, and risk-free rate.
- **Python Notebook**: The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to modify parameters and see immediate results.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seedhantkalra/black-scholes-option-pricing.git

2. **Install required dependencies**

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

## Usage
- Open the Black-Scholes Option Pricing.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
- Follow the instructions within the notebook to enter your parameters.
- Execute the cells to calculate option prices and Greeks based on the Black-Scholes model.
